# New-York-food-deserts
Hi. this is the codespace for New York food deserts. A food desert is a geographic area, often low income, with limited access to affordable, nutrious food like fresh foods and vegetables. 
This repository documents the creation of my ArcGIS StoryMap project analyzing food access, food deserts, and the impact of Project EATS on the cultural food landscape of New York City.
The project explores how limited access to fresh food, the presence of food deserts, and the concentration of fast-food restaurants affect community health—especially in neighborhoods like the Bronx and Brooklyn.
By mapping Project EATS farms, farmers markets, and other food access indicators, the StoryMap visualizes how urban agriculture helps fill critical gaps in NYC’s food system.

To begin the project, I gathered all the datasets needed to analyze food access in New York City. This included collecting the official locations of Project EATS farms from their website and compiling a list of farmers markets from GrowNYC and additional NYC market resources. I also downloaded food access datasets—such as the Supermarket Need Index and other food environment layers—from NYC Open Data. In addition, I located subway stations and transportation layers to support the accessibility analysis included in the StoryMap.

Once all data was collected, I cleaned and formatted the CSV and GeoJSON files to make sure they were compatible with ArcGIS. This required checking coordinates, removing duplicates, and organizing data into the correct structure. All datasets were then sorted into clearly labeled folders to keep the repository organized and easy to navigate.

Using ArcGIS Online, I created a series of web maps that visualize different aspects of the project. These maps include Project EATS farms, farmers markets, food deserts, transportation access, and related spatial patterns. I applied custom icons, colors, and symbology to clearly distinguish each layer and added pop-ups with relevant information. Screenshots of the maps were exported and saved for documentation purposes.

After the maps were created, I built the StoryMap by writing the narrative that explains food deserts, food access inequality, cultural landscape changes, and the mission of Project EATS. I embedded each map, image, dataset, and visual element into the StoryMap layout. Citations, section titles, and formatting choices were added to create a clean, cohesive, and easy-to-follow final presentation.

To complete the project, I uploaded all datasets, images, maps, and workflow materials to GitHub. This repository documents the entire process, including data sources, preparation steps, mapping decisions, and the organization of project files. The README serves as the central guide for understanding how the StoryMap was created from start to finish.
